# LD_2686-e-yantra-Robotics-Competition
We developed a luminosity drone for the e-Yantra Robotics Competition, a national-level robotics contest in India conducted by IIT Bombay . The drone was designed to detect and report alien life forms on an unknown planet using ROS and specialized robotic components. The drone followed a fixed path on the terrain and used sensors and algorithms to identify the coordinates and species of any encountered aliens. After exploring the whole map, the drone returned to the research station and transmitted the collected data.
